This site showcases my **recent** game development work using Unity 3D, from the last 3 years.\r\n\r\n## Well, who are you?\r\nMy name is Emanuel Tavares, I'm a Unity 3D game developer from Brazil. I have been working with Unity since 2012.\r\n\r\n## Let's see what you can do\r\n\r\nHere they are:\r\n\r\n### Talking Rocks\r\nMy first actual job in game development was in [Skillab](http://www.skillab.com/). Up to that point I was developing research projects with Unity 3D and never had finished a game. Skillab acquired another company which made games in XNA and their plan was to migrate everything to Unity and launch in every store possible. However, they also wanted to create a new game from the ground and they assigned me to develop it. After six months, Talking Rocks was born.\r\n\r\n![TalkingRocks0](/images/talkingrocks0.png)\r\n\r\nTalking Rocks is Candy Crush with a vikings motiff, there's no better way to explain. Players are supposed to beat each stage of all the islands, in order. In a stage you play a \"Candy Crush\" minigame where you have to obtain a certain number of points to complete that section. After that you need to complete an educational minigame about english words. Only after that, the stage ends. Completing every stage in an island grants you a special shield. When all shields are obtained, you win a Magic Shield, a dragon, a very long scroll and the game ends.\r\n\r\nThe game features 25 levels with six types of educational minigames. It uses very few plugins, as far as I can recall, I implemented only the Prime31 billing plugins. The majority of the code in the game was developed by me. However there were a few instances where other people contributed:\r\n- One of the minigames was not developed by me.\r\n- I needed a lot of help with other platforms, specially iOS and Windows. I never forgot that one of my colleagues developed a virtual keyboard for Talking Rocks so it could be approved in the Microsoft Store.\r\n- After I left the company, the game went through a few changes. It became free to play with ads. Before that, you could play until the end of the first island and the game asked you to pay to get access to the rest. \r\n\r\nThe game can be played in the following platforms: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skillab.talkingrocks), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/talking-rocks/id783718100?mt=8) and [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/store/p/talking-rocks/9wzdncrds4kl).\r\n\r\nTalking Rocks was the first game I worked with that was uploaded to a store. \r\n It was a **big** challenge for me, since I developed almost every aspect of the gameplay. Other colleagues gave me a lot of help porting it to Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Metro and iOS.",
